# PetFinder data analysis

1) Fetch ~50,000 profiles of adoptable dogs from PetFinder through the API with **FETCH_PetFinder_data.ipynb**

2) For each state, determine the number of dogs listed and identify most popular dog breeds and names with **stats_per_state.ipynb**

3) Use data from the US Census to provide context for the PetFinder data

	- Use **census_ACS_analysis.ipynb** to retrieve and interpret economic and household data for each state from the 2023 ACS 1-year data

	- Compare the census data to the PetFinder state-by-state analysis results with **compare_to_census.ipynb**
